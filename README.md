# Hangman

Hangman is a simple command-line game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a word based on the specified difficulty level and prompts the player to guess letters to uncover the hidden word. The player has a limited number of lives, and incorrect guesses result in the hanging of a stick figure. The player wins if they correctly guess all the letters in the word before running out of lives.

## Usage
- Run the script: `python hangman.py`
- Enter the level of difficulty (easy/medium/hard/expert).
- Guess letters to uncover the hidden word.
- The game provides hints based on the remaining lives.
- If the player wins or loses, they are prompted to play again or quit.
